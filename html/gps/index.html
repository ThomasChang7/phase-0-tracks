	What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
		The purpose of the semantic tags is to provide meaning to the content on the page. It is how the developer labels each section of the content. I see the ones being the most useful as main and article.
	What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
		The order the browser uses to display elements to the best of my knowledge is first the Doc type declaration, then the html tag, then a head tag for the title, and then the body with the content displayed to whoever is accessing the page.
	What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
		I learned more about snippets in this challenge. It was mind blowing and will definitely be very useful as a developer. 
	What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
		I initially had difficulty understanding snippets and how to create one. I will watch youtube videos and go look up blogs about snippets to further my understanding of snippets.
