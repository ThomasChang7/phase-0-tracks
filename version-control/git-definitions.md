# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version control allows a team of users to view the history of a file or code. This will allow them to better manage a project. For example, if an error was made in the project in regards to a file, document, or code, the team can simply roll back the project to an earlier iteration of it to fix the mistake. Also, this allows several developers to be working on different aspects of the same project. This is useful because it allows for a more efficient work flow. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is a timeline or module splitting off from the master file. It is related to version control and allows for a developer to work and contribute to a product without altering the master code. A developer would use one because the code he is working on may be unstable and full of bugs and one may not want these changes to go onto the master unless its stable. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - Before talking about commits, we need to talk about git add. There is a staging area which files need to be added to before the process of committing. "Git add" informs git about the changes one would like to make. Git commit actually allows these changes to be made to the working directory. It gives the user a snapshot into the history of the project on hand. A good commit message will tell the user why a change was made and not the simple fact that a change was made. For example, a poor commit message may be, updated file, fixed errors, added to file. A good commit message makes these changes more specific, for example, updated file to include certain so and so. It allows for other developers to better understand why and how these certain changes are made. 
* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict occurs when the same parts of two different branches or a branch and the master has both made different changes to the same line or code. It occurs when both are compared and git will notify the user of any conflicts before the merger.
