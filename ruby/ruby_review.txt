Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
Data structures allow the programmer to store and organize data in a computer to be used later on and to be used efficiently.

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
An array is a collection of any objects. This collection can be index through to find a specific element of an array.
For example, fruits = [apple, banana, orange, pineapple] would be an array and fruits[1] would return banana.

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
One example of a data set that an array would be well suited for can be a collection of vowels. vowels = ["a","e","i","o","u"]
Another example of a data set appropriate for an array may be types of cookies. cookies = ["chocolate chip", "raisin", "oatmeal"]

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
A hash has pairs of data, a key and a value pertaining to that key.
hash = { "Jane Doe" => 10, "John Doe" => 6" }
5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
One example can be the rooms of a house. house = { first_floor: ["kitchen", living room], second_floor: "Under Construction"}
Another example can be pets and their age. pets = {bruno: 10, spike: 3, garfield: 7, brian: 5 }
Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
Iteration is useful because it allows the repetition of a task. Or it can be used on a block of code and instead of writing 26 times, the user can have it iterate over the block of code and specify when to end.
7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
Play each song of a jukebox in a diner.
Blocks
8. What is a block?
A block is code that functions as a small program within the code. It's syntax is different and can be done using { |x| puts x} or
do |x|
puts x
end
9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
The block parameter's value depends on the method being called. So for example, [1,2,3,4,5].each { |x| x * 2}, the |x| is the block paramter and it's value depends on the item being looked upon in the array. The |x| will change through each iteration.
Variables
1. What is a variable? Why might a programmer use a variable?
Variables are used to store information. Programmers use these to use a specific data throughout a program.
2. If the value of first_name is "Abraham" and last_name is "Lincoln", explain the order in which Ruby will run the line full_name = first_name + last_name, and what the final result will be.
So this is not like grade school where 1 + 1 = 2 where things start on the left and end on the right. The final product is the one on the left side in programming and the final result is "AbrahamLincoln" without the spaces because no spaces were specified.
Data Types
3. For each of the following data types, write a short definition and give at least one example of when you might use the data type in a program. (Don't use an example we've already provided.)

string - represents characters, such as "foobar"
integer - represents whole numbers, can be used to perform arithmetic
float - represents precise numbers, specifically with decimal point representation, used in arithmetic
nil - special value representing the absence of a value
boolean -  true or false, can be used as a switch to leave a loop
Algorithms
4. What is an algorithm?
a step by step sequence to be used to perform calculations, operations, and tells the computer how to perform a specific task
5. What are two common categories of algorithm in computer science?
there are recursive algorithms and divide and conquer algorithms.
Methods
6. What is a method? Why might a programmer choose to use a method?
A method is basically a function and tells the computer what to do with certain data.
7. Define the following terms as they relate to a method.

return value - what the computer gets after using a method on data.
side effect - some modification of a non local variable or an interaction with calling methods
parameter - value located in the parentheses of a method. These are arbitrary names and various values can be placed in.
argument - data passed into the method's parameters. argument actually holds a value
implicit return - value returned by the last statement
8. What are global scope and method scope? How do those scopes impact the availability of data at different points in a program?
global scope refers to data that exists in the whole program. method scope refers to data that only exists in that specific instance of the method.
Control Flow
9. What is control flow? Why might a programmer choose to use flow control?
How we control the course of the ruby program. It may involve loops and conditionals.
10. Define the following terms as they relate to flow control.

loop -  executed multiple times
if - only executed after reaching a certain condition
else - used in conjunction with if, if a certain condition is not satisfied, this is run instead
elsif - used with if and else, elsif if similar to if where there needs to be a condition to be satisfied
while - while an expression is true, continue this loop
until - runs code until the condition is false
