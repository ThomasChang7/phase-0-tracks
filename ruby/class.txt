1. What are classes? Be sure to define the following terms in your explanation and describe the relationships between them:
class - A class involves designing an object. They provide instructions on the characteristics and behaviors of an object.
state - Characteristics, data of each instance, such as age, height, width, depth, weight
behavior - known as methods
instance variable - Each member belonging to a class is known as an instance
instance method - Methods called on an instance of a class. For example, you cant call bark on a species, but you can call bark on a dog.
2. What are attributes?
A special variable used inside a class declaration. Each instance of a class may have different attributes, such as different colored hair, eyes, and skin.
3. Give an example of a real world object, and describe how you might assign its attributes if you were to design a class to represent that object.
Attributes I would assign a cat would be hair length, hair color, eye color, breed, size, temperament, etc.
4. What is the purpose of the initialize method? When does it run?
The purpose of the initialize method is to put some default value into all the instance variables.
5. What are modules?
A module is a way to organize and compartmentalize methods.
6. What are the different ways you can use a module?
Modules can be used as mixins meaning that they can be mixed into classes. For example, planes fly and birds fly so we can use a fly module to be included into
both classes in order to avoid tedious typing when they both do the same thing.
