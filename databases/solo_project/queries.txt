Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
SELECT * FROM books
Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
UPDATE books SET fiction="true" WHERE title="Ethan Frome"
Display the information in both tables using one query.
SELECT * FROM books, authors WHERE books.author_id = authors.id;
Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
SELECT books.title, authors.name FROM books JOIN authors ON books.author_id = authors.id;
Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
DELETE FROM books WHERE id=12;

SELECT books.title, authors.name, fiction FROM books LEFT JOIN authors ON books.author_id = authors.id;
SELECT books.title, authors.name FROM books INNER JOIN authors ON books.author_id = authors.id;
